NOTE: this month's meeting is at the earlier time of 6.30pm!


Open source is a big part of the Ruby community. This month we're
getting together to hack on some open source projects and give something
back.

If you've got a project you want to contribute to but don't know how,
come along and pair with another developer. We'll also put together a
list of bugs to fix or projects that need some developer time. If you're an experienced
open source committer and you could lend a hand then that would be much
appreciated.

Bring a laptop and, if you have any, some ideas on things to hack on.

## Where

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+ event](https://plus.google.com/) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out to the pub afterwards.
